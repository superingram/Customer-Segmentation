# Customer-Sentiment
ACME is one of the fastest growing startups in the logistics and delivery domain. We work with several partners and make on-demand delivery to our customers. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we are facing several different challenges and everyday we are trying to address these challenges.  At ACME we thrive for making our customers happy. As a growing startup, with a global expansion strategy we know that we need to make our customers happy and the only way to do that is to measure how happy each customer is. If we can predict what makes our customers happy or unhappy, we can then take necessary actions.  Getting feedback from customers is not easy either, but we do our best to get constant feedback from our customers. This is a crucial function to improve our operations across all levels. A random forest will be utilized initially and feature importances will be extracted.  Further enhancements to this project will be performed after initial assessment.
